        "text": "Welcome to my website!\n\nI created this website in VSCode to showcases projects I have designed, developed, or contributed to over the years. Whether it's an Android app, a full-stack website, or a set of low-level memory management functions in assembly, each project represents a step in my growth as a developer. I enjoy working on all levels accross the stack, and I'm always exploring new languages, paradigms, and problem solving techniques. From low-level systems to high-level designs, I enjoy building solutions from the ground up.\n\nFeel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect!\n\nThanks for visiting!"
